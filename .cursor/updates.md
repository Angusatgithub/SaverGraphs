# Project Updates

## May 14, 2024 - Initial Setup and Stories 1.1-1.4

### Project Structure Setup
- Initialized React Native project with Expo and TypeScript
- Set up dark theme configuration in layout
- Created basic project structure with `app` and `components` directories
- Added proper TypeScript configuration

### Story 1.1: Display API Key Input
- Created reusable `ThemedText` component for consistent text styling across the app
- Implemented `ApiKeyInput` component with:
  - Secure text input field
  - Dark theme styling
  - Proper text input properties (secureTextEntry, autoCapitalize, autoCorrect)
- Updated main app screen to display the API key input
- Configured proper layout with dark theme and status bar settings

### Story 1.2: Implement API Key Submission
- Enhanced `ApiKeyInput` component with:
  - Added submit button with proper styling
  - Implemented loading state handling
  - Added button state management (disabled, pressed)
- Updated main app screen with:
  - Added API key submission handler
  - Implemented loading state management
  - Added placeholder for API validation
- Fixed component export issues:
  - Updated `ThemedText` to use default export
  - Fixed import statements accordingly

### Story 1.3: Validate API Key via Ping Utility
- Created Up API service with:
  - Implemented ping utility endpoint integration
  - Added proper error handling with custom `UpApiError` class
  - Added type-safe response handling
- Created `ErrorMessage` component for displaying validation errors
- Enhanced main app screen with:
  - Integrated API key validation
  - Added error state management
  - Implemented proper error display
  - Added success state placeholder

### Story 1.4: Display API Key Validation Success
- Created `SuccessMessage` component with:
  - Animated fade in/out transitions
  - Consistent styling with app theme
  - Completion callback support
- Added secure storage service:
  - Implemented API key storage using expo-secure-store
  - Added utility functions for key management
- Enhanced main app screen with:
  - Added success state management
  - Integrated secure API key storage
  - Added navigation to dashboard placeholder
- Created placeholder dashboard screen for future implementation

### Repository Setup
- Created comprehensive README.md with:
  - Project description
  - Feature list
  - Tech stack details
  - Setup instructions
  - Environment requirements
- Added MIT License
- Set up GitHub repository at https://github.com/Angusatgithub/SaverGraphs
- Pushed initial codebase to GitHub

### Code Organization
- Following component structure guidelines:
  - Components in dedicated directory
  - TypeScript for type safety
  - Proper file naming conventions
- Implemented dark theme by default
- Set up proper navigation structure with Expo Router
- Added services directory for API interactions and storage

### Next Steps
- Implement Story 1.5: Display API Key Validation Failure
- Enhance error handling with specific error messages
- Add retry functionality for failed validations

## May 15, 2024 - API Key Validation & UX Fixes

### Improved API Key Validation Logic
- Updated API key validation to accept the correct Up API format (`up:yeah:yourtoken`).
- Removed overly strict format checks that rejected valid tokens with colons.
- Now only checks for the correct prefix and valid token part.

### Robust Success/Error Handling
- Updated main app logic to treat any HTTP 200 response from the Up API as a valid key (no longer relies on emoji in response).
- Improved error handling: only shows error if an exception is thrown, otherwise proceeds to success.
- Ensured that a successful API key submission triggers a success message and navigates to the dashboard.
- Improved user feedback for both error and success states.

### UI/UX Enhancements
- Updated API key input helper text and placeholder to clearly show the required format (`up:yeah:yourtoken`).
- Added real-time validation and clearer error messages for invalid formats.

### Next Steps
- Proceed to implement Story 1.5: Display API Key Validation Failure with more granular error messages and retry options.

## May 15, 2024 - Auto-Login with Stored API Key (Story 1.7)

### Retrieve and Validate API Key on Launch
- On app launch, the app now checks for a stored API key using SecureStore.
- If a key is found, it is validated with the Up API ping endpoint.
- If valid, the user is automatically navigated to the dashboard, skipping the API key input screen.
- If not found or invalid, the API key input screen is shown as usual.
- Loading state is shown while checking for a stored key to prevent UI flicker.

### Testing
- Verified that entering a valid key and relaunching the app skips the input screen and goes straight to the dashboard.
- Verified that an invalid or missing key shows the input screen as expected.

## May 15, 2024 - Fetch and Display Accounts (Story 2.1)

### Fetch List of Accounts
- Implemented Up API integration to fetch all user accounts after login or auto-login.
- Added new service function to call the `/accounts` endpoint and parse the response.

### Display in Dashboard
- Updated dashboard to display each account's display name, type, and balance.
- Fixed bug: now uses `displayName` (not `name`) for account names, per Up API docs.
- Improved dashboard UI for account listing.

### Testing
- Verified that accounts are fetched and displayed with correct names, types, and balances after login.

## May 15, 2024 - Filter and Display Savings Accounts (Story 2.2)

### Filter for SAVER Accounts
- Updated logic to filter fetched accounts and only include those with `accountType === 'SAVER'` (savings accounts).
- Only savings accounts are now passed to and displayed in the dashboard.

### Dashboard Update
- Changed dashboard title to "Your Savings Accounts" for clarity.

### Testing
- Verified that only savings accounts are shown after login, and other account types are excluded from the dashboard list.
