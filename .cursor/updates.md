### Code Organization
- Following component structure guidelines:
  - Components in dedicated directory
  - TypeScript for type safety
  - Proper file naming conventions
- Implemented dark theme by default
- Set up proper navigation structure with Expo Router
- Added services directory for API interactions and storage

### Next Steps
- Implement Story 1.5: Display API Key Validation Failure
- Enhance error handling with specific error messages
- Add retry functionality for failed validations

## May 15, 2024 - API Key Validation & UX Fixes

### Improved API Key Validation Logic
- Updated API key validation to accept the correct Up API format (`up:yeah:yourtoken`).
- Removed overly strict format checks that rejected valid tokens with colons.
- Now only checks for the correct prefix and valid token part.

### Robust Success/Error Handling
- Updated main app logic to treat any HTTP 200 response from the Up API as a valid key (no longer relies on emoji in response).
- Improved error handling: only shows error if an exception is thrown, otherwise proceeds to success.
- Ensured that a successful API key submission triggers a success message and navigates to the dashboard.
- Improved user feedback for both error and success states.

### UI/UX Enhancements
- Updated API key input helper text and placeholder to clearly show the required format (`up:yeah:yourtoken`).
- Added real-time validation and clearer error messages for invalid formats.

### Next Steps
- Proceed to implement Story 1.5: Display API Key Validation Failure with more granular error messages and retry options.

## May 15, 2024 - Auto-Login with Stored API Key (Story 1.7)

### Retrieve and Validate API Key on Launch
- On app launch, the app now checks for a stored API key using SecureStore.
- If a key is found, it is validated with the Up API ping endpoint.
- If valid, the user is automatically navigated to the dashboard, skipping the API key input screen.
- If not found or invalid, the API key input screen is shown as usual.
- Loading state is shown while checking for a stored key to prevent UI flicker.

### Testing
- Verified that entering a valid key and relaunching the app skips the input screen and goes straight to the dashboard.
- Verified that an invalid or missing key shows the input screen as expected.

## May 15, 2024 - Fetch and Display Accounts (Story 2.1)

### Fetch List of Accounts
- Implemented Up API integration to fetch all user accounts after login or auto-login.
- Added new service function to call the `/accounts` endpoint and parse the response.

### Display in Dashboard
- Updated dashboard to display each account's display name, type, and balance.
- Fixed bug: now uses `displayName` (not `name`) for account names, per Up API docs.
- Improved dashboard UI for account listing.

### Testing
- Verified that accounts are fetched and displayed with correct names, types, and balances after login.

## May 15, 2024 - Filter and Display Savings Accounts (Story 2.2)

### Filter for SAVER Accounts
- Updated logic to filter fetched accounts and only include those with `accountType === 'SAVER'` (savings accounts).
- Only savings accounts are now passed to and displayed in the dashboard.

### Dashboard Update
- Changed dashboard title to "Your Savings Accounts" for clarity.

### Testing
- Verified that only savings accounts are shown after login, and other account types are excluded from the dashboard list.

## May 15, 2024 - Fetch and Summarize Transactions (Story 2.3)

### Fetch Recent Transactions
- Implemented service function to fetch recent transactions (last 90 days) for each SAVER (savings) account from the Up API.
- After fetching accounts, the app now fetches transactions for each and stores a summary (count per account) in state.

### Dashboard Update
- Dashboard now displays the number of transactions (last 90 days) for each savings account.

### Testing
- Verified that transaction counts are fetched and displayed for each savings account after login.

## May 15, 2024 - Correct Transaction Processing (Story 3.0)

### Story 3.0: Process Transactions into Date/Balance Data Points
- Modified the `processBalances` helper function in `app/index.tsx`.
- The function now correctly calculates daily aggregated balances for saver accounts according to the acceptance criteria:
  - It determines each account's balance for days it had transactions using the `balanceAfter` of the last transaction of that day.
  - It collects all unique dates across all accounts that had transaction activity.
  - For each such unique date (sorted chronologically), it calculates an aggregated total balance.
  - If an account had a transaction on the current date, its `balanceAfter` is used.
  - If an account did *not* have a transaction on the current date, its most recently known `balanceAfter` (from a previous transaction day in the sorted list) is carried forward to the current date's aggregation.
  - If an account has had no transactions up to the current date in the sorted list, it contributes 0 to the aggregate until its first transaction.
- This ensures the `balanceSummary` (containing `dates` and `balances`) provided to the dashboard is accurate for future graph plotting.

## May 16, 2024 - Basic Graph Canvas (Story 3.1)

### Story 3.1: Display Basic Skia Line Graph Canvas
- Installed `@shopify/react-native-skia` library.
- Created `BalanceChart.tsx` component in `components/`.
- The component renders a React Native Skia `<Canvas>` element.
- Drew a simple line path using hardcoded data points as a placeholder.
- Integrated `BalanceChart` into the `DashboardScreen.tsx` for display.

## May 16, 2024 - Plot Aggregated Savings Balance (Story 3.2)

### Story 3.2: Plot Aggregated Savings Balance on Graph
- Updated `BalanceChart` to accept `dates` and `balances` as props.
- Scaled and mapped real savings data to chart coordinates.
- Rendered the line path using the actual aggregated balance data.
- Updated `Dashboard` to pass `balanceSummary` to the chart.
- Chart now displays the user's real savings trend over time.
