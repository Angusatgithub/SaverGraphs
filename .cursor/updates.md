## May 15, 2024 - API Key Validation & UX Fixes

### Improved API Key Validation Logic
- Updated API key validation to accept the correct Up API format (`up:yeah:yourtoken`).
- Removed overly strict format checks that rejected valid tokens with colons.
- Now only checks for the correct prefix and valid token part.

### Robust Success/Error Handling
- Updated main app logic to treat any HTTP 200 response from the Up API as a valid key (no longer relies on emoji in response).
- Improved error handling: only shows error if an exception is thrown, otherwise proceeds to success.
- Ensured that a successful API key submission triggers a success message and navigates to the dashboard.
- Improved user feedback for both error and success states.

### UI/UX Enhancements
- Updated API key input helper text and placeholder to clearly show the required format (`up:yeah:yourtoken`).
- Added real-time validation and clearer error messages for invalid formats.

### Next Steps
- Proceed to implement Story 1.5: Display API Key Validation Failure with more granular error messages and retry options.

## May 15, 2024 - Auto-Login with Stored API Key (Story 1.7)

### Retrieve and Validate API Key on Launch
- On app launch, the app now checks for a stored API key using SecureStore.
- If a key is found, it is validated with the Up API ping endpoint.
- If valid, the user is automatically navigated to the dashboard, skipping the API key input screen.
- If not found or invalid, the API key input screen is shown as usual.
- Loading state is shown while checking for a stored key to prevent UI flicker.

### Testing
- Verified that entering a valid key and relaunching the app skips the input screen and goes straight to the dashboard.
- Verified that an invalid or missing key shows the input screen as expected.

## May 15, 2024 - Fetch and Display Accounts (Story 2.1)

### Fetch List of Accounts
- Implemented Up API integration to fetch all user accounts after login or auto-login.
- Added new service function to call the `/accounts` endpoint and parse the response.

### Display in Dashboard
- Updated dashboard to display each account's display name, type, and balance.
- Fixed bug: now uses `displayName` (not `name`) for account names, per Up API docs.
- Improved dashboard UI for account listing.

### Testing
- Verified that accounts are fetched and displayed with correct names, types, and balances after login.

## May 15, 2024 - Filter and Display Savings Accounts (Story 2.2)

### Filter for SAVER Accounts
- Updated logic to filter fetched accounts and only include those with `accountType === 'SAVER'` (savings accounts).
- Only savings accounts are now passed to and displayed in the dashboard.

### Dashboard Update
- Changed dashboard title to "Your Savings Accounts" for clarity.

### Testing
- Verified that only savings accounts are shown after login, and other account types are excluded from the dashboard list.

## May 15, 2024 - Fetch and Summarize Transactions (Story 2.3)

### Fetch Recent Transactions
- Implemented service function to fetch recent transactions (last 90 days) for each SAVER (savings) account from the Up API.
- After fetching accounts, the app now fetches transactions for each and stores a summary (count per account) in state.

### Dashboard Update
- Dashboard now displays the number of transactions (last 90 days) for each savings account.

### Testing
- Verified that transaction counts are fetched and displayed for each savings account after login.

## May 15, 2024 - Correct Transaction Processing (Story 3.0)

### Story 3.0: Process Transactions into Date/Balance Data Points
- Modified the `processBalances` helper function in `app/index.tsx`.
- The function now correctly calculates daily aggregated balances for saver accounts according to the acceptance criteria:
  - It determines each account's balance for days it had transactions using the `balanceAfter` of the last transaction of that day.
  - It collects all unique dates across all accounts that had transaction activity.
  - For each such unique date (sorted chronologically), it calculates an aggregated total balance.
  - If an account had a transaction on the current date, its `balanceAfter` is used.
  - If an account did *not* have a transaction on the current date, its most recently known `balanceAfter` (from a previous transaction day in the sorted list) is carried forward to the current date's aggregation.
  - If an account has had no transactions up to the current date in the sorted list, it contributes 0 to the aggregate until its first transaction.
- This ensures the `balanceSummary` (containing `dates` and `balances`) provided to the dashboard is accurate for future graph plotting.

## May 16, 2024 - Basic Graph Canvas (Story 3.1)

### Story 3.1: Display Basic Skia Line Graph Canvas
- Installed `@shopify/react-native-skia` library.
- Created `BalanceChart.tsx` component in `components/`.
- The component renders a React Native Skia `<Canvas>` element.
- Drew a simple line path using hardcoded data points as a placeholder.
- Integrated `BalanceChart` into the `DashboardScreen.tsx` for display.

## May 16, 2024 - Plot Aggregated Savings Balance (Story 3.2)

### Story 3.2: Plot Aggregated Savings Balance on Graph
- Updated `BalanceChart` to accept `dates` and `balances` as props.
- Scaled and mapped real savings data to chart coordinates.
- Rendered the line path using the actual aggregated balance data.
- Updated `Dashboard` to pass `balanceSummary` to the chart.
- Chart now displays the user's real savings trend over time.

## May 16, 2024 - Enhancement: Accurate Chart Range

- Updated BalanceChart to start the X-axis at the first real data point (not before).
- Y-axis now uses the true minimum balance in the data (not $0 unless $0 is present).
- This prevents misleading drops to zero and makes the graph more accurate and visually representative.

## May 16, 2024 - Enhancement: Chart Axis Labels

- Added Y-axis labels for min and max balance (always shows at least $0 and the highest balance).
- Added X-axis labels for the first and last date in the data.
- Labels styled for dark theme and positioned around the Skia canvas for clarity.

## May 16, 2024 - Bugfix: Carry-Forward Balance in processBalances

- Fixed the processBalances helper to correctly carry forward the last known balance for each account on days with no transaction.
- This prevents sudden drops to zero and ensures the savings graph is smooth and accurate.

## May 16, 2024 - Chart UI Improvements: Stock App Style

- Right-aligned both min and max balance labels, positioned at the top right and bottom right of the chart area.
- Added faint horizontal guide lines at the top and bottom of the chart.
- Adjusted the Y coordinate calculation so the graph line touches both guide lines when hitting min/max values.
- Ensured min/max labels are precisely aligned with their respective guide lines, mimicking the style of modern investment/stock apps.

## May 16, 2024 - Graph Placeholders (Story 3.3)

### Story 3.3: Display Graph Placeholder for No Data/Loading
- Updated `BalanceChart.tsx` to accept an `isLoading` prop.
- If `isLoading` is true, the chart displays a "Loading savings data..." message.
- If `isLoading` is false and no data (`dates` or `balances` are empty), the chart displays "No savings data to display." and renders a flat line at $0.
- Modified `app/dashboard.tsx` to accept `isLoading` prop and pass it to `BalanceChart`.
- Updated `app/index.tsx` to pass its `isLoading` state to the `Dashboard` component.
- This ensures the user sees appropriate feedback during data fetching or when no data is available for the chart.

## May 16, 2024 - Graph Touch/Scrub Gestures (Story 3.4)

### Story 3.4: Implement Tap/Scrub Gesture on Graph
- Refactored touch handling in `components/BalanceChart.tsx` to use `react-native-gesture-handler` instead of Skia's internal touch system.
- Imported `GestureDetector` and `Gesture` from `react-native-gesture-handler`.
- Added `GestureHandlerRootView` to `app/_layout.tsx` to enable gesture handling.
- Implemented a pan gesture (`Gesture.Pan()`) to detect tap/scrub actions.
- Used `useSharedValue` from `react-native-reanimated` to store touch state (`touchX`, `touchY`, `isActive`).
- Wrapped the chart view with `<GestureDetector>`.
- Touch coordinates (absolute within the component) are logged to the console during `onBegin` and `onUpdate` phases of the gesture, fulfilling the acceptance criteria for detecting touch coordinates.
- Corrected event payload types for gesture callbacks (e.g., `PanGestureHandlerEventPayload`).

## May 16, 2024 - Graph Interaction Callout (Story 3.5)

### Story 3.5: Display Callout with Date/Balance on Graph Interaction
- Implemented callout display in `components/BalanceChart.tsx`.
- Added React state (`useState`) to manage callout data (selected date, balance, position, visibility).
- In the `onUpdate` phase of the `panGesture` (from `react-native-gesture-handler`):
  - Calculated the closest data point (date/balance) based on the touch's X-coordinate relative to the chart.
  - Used `runOnJS` to update the React state with the selected data and calculated callout position from the gesture handler.
- Rendered a React Native `<View>` as the callout, absolutely positioned near the touch interaction point (above the data point on the graph line).
- The callout displays the formatted date and balance of the selected point.
- The callout appears during scrubbing and disappears when the gesture ends (`onEnd`).
- Ensured callout positioning attempts to stay within screen bounds.

### Story 3.5 Debugging Notes:
- Encountered a persistent runtime error where a locally defined helper function (`formatDateForCalloutLabel` or `formatDateLabel`) was being treated as an object (`typeof` reported "object") specifically when called from the gesture handler context, leading to "is not a function" or ".call is not a function" errors.
- Renaming, redefining as arrow function, and explicit `.call()` did not resolve the issue initially.
- The issue was resolved by keeping the date formatting logic for the callout *inlined* within the gesture handler's `onUpdate` callback (inside the `runOnJS` block). The axis label formatting, using the same helper function but called during the main render pass, worked correctly once the function definition was restored to avoid `ReferenceError`.
- This suggests a subtle issue with function references or closures in the Reanimated/Gesture Handler to JS thread bridge for that specific call path, or a bundler/runtime anomaly.

## May 16, 2024 - Default Monthly Graph View (Story 4.9)

### Story 4.9: Update Graph to Default Monthly View
- Added `currentTimeframe` state to `app/index.tsx`, defaulting to `'Monthly'` (other options `'All'` for now).
- Modified `processBalances` function to accept the `currentTimeframe`.
- The function first calculates the full 90-day balance history as before.
- If `currentTimeframe` is `'Monthly'`, it then filters this full history:
  - Determines the start (1st of current month) and end (today) dates for the current calendar month.
  - Extracts data points falling within this range.
  - Implemented logic to find the balance just before the current month started and prepends this balance as the data point for the 1st of the current month if no actual transaction data exists on the 1st but there was a prior balance.
  - If no transactions occurred in the current month, it displays the carried-forward balance from the start of the month for both the 1st and today's date (if different).
- This ensures the graph, by default, displays aggregated savings data for the current calendar month.
